# Hashing-using-Python

This repository contains the functions of hash function using hashlib in python.

The below table describes the avilabel hash algorithms and their uses check it outðŸ‘‡


|Algorithms|Functions|
|:----------|:---------:|
|blake2b | A cryptographic hash function optimized for 64-bit platforms.|
|blake2s | Similar to blake2b, but optimized for 8- to 32-bit platforms.|
|md5 | A widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. |
|sha1 |  Like MD5, it is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities.|
|sha224 | It produces a 224-bit hash value.|
|sha256 | It produces a a 384-bit hash value. |
|sha384| It produces 384-bit hash value. |
|sha3_224 | It is designed to provide a high level of security and resistance against various cryptographic attacks.|
|sha3_256|The larger output size offers a larger hash space, making it more resistant to collision attacks.|
|sha3_384 |It provides a longer hash output, which can be useful in certain applications where a larger hash space is desired for added security.|
|sha3_512 | It produces a 512-bit hash value. It is suitable for applications where a very high level of cryptographic security is required. |
|sha512 | It produces a a 512-bit hash value.|
|shake_128 | In the case of shake_128, it produces a variable-length output but is commonly used to generate hash values of 128 bits or more.|
|shake_256 |It is designed for applications where a longer hash length is desired. It can be used to generate hash values of 256 bits or more.|
